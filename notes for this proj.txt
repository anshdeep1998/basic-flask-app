We will create simple hello world flask application and deploy it on heroku using docker as of now.

We will then work on ml project, then keep changing our functionalities from our system  which should be visible in heroku deployed version
also. We will create an automated pipeline such that whatever changes we make, they are visible on heroku deployed version also.

Now we will learn to establish CI/CD pipeline.

we will be deploying our application in heroku cloud and use github as repository.
